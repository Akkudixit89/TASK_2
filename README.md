# 🛡️ Phishing Awareness and Detection
# 📘 Overview
Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. This repository is dedicated to educating users on phishing threats and providing guidance on how to detect and avoid them.

# 🎯 What Is Phishing?
Phishing is a form of social engineering used by cybercriminals to deceive users into taking harmful actions. Common phishing methods include:

Email phishing – Fraudulent emails that appear to come from reputable sources.

Spear phishing – Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or organizations.

Smishing – Phishing via SMS or text messages.

Vishing – Voice phishing over the phone.

Clone phishing – Creating a nearly identical copy of a legitimate email with malicious links or attachments.

# 🚨 How to Detect Phishing
Here are key indicators to watch for:

# 🔗 Suspicious Links
Hover over links to preview the actual URL.

Look for slight misspellings or domain spoofing (e.g., amaz0n.com instead of amazon.com).

📧 Unexpected or Unfamiliar Senders
Be cautious of emails from unknown addresses or slightly altered domains.

Double-check the sender’s email address, especially if the message creates a sense of urgency.

⚠️ Urgent or Threatening Language
Phishing emails often create panic (e.g., "Your account will be locked!") to prompt quick action without thinking.

🧩 Requests for Sensitive Information
Legitimate organizations never ask for passwords, SSNs, or credit card numbers over email or text.

📎 Suspicious Attachments
Be wary of unexpected attachments, especially with file types like .exe, .scr, .zip, or .docm.

🛠️ What To Do If You Suspect a Phishing Attempt
Do not click on links or download attachments.

Do not respond to the message.

Report the email or message to your organization’s IT/security team.

Delete the message once reported.

Use security tools (like email filters and antivirus software) to scan suspicious content.
